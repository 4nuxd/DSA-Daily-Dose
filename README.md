# DSA-Daily-Dose 📚💻

Welcome to **DSA Daily Dose**! 🎯  
This repository is my **personal space** to practice and master **Data Structures** and **Algorithms (DSA)** through consistent daily problem-solving. 🚀

Every day, I solve problems from various topics like **arrays**, **linked lists**, **trees**, **graphs**, **dynamic programming**, and more. 🧠💡 The aim is to build a deep understanding of key concepts and improve problem-solving skills for **coding interviews**, **competitive programming**, and general **software development**. 👨‍💻👩‍💻

💡 **What's Inside?**  
- **🧮 Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, etc.
- **📚 Data Structures**: Arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, and more.
- **🧩 Patterns**: Common problem-solving strategies like sliding window, backtracking, two-pointer, etc.
- **💡 Dynamic Programming**: Dive deep into dynamic programming problems and solutions.
- **🏞️ Graphs**: Explore graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, shortest paths, etc.
- **📅 Daily Practice**: Track my daily progress with explanations, solutions, and insights.

🎯 **My Goal**:  
- Solve 1-3 problems a day to continuously improve.
- Master DSA concepts and algorithms.
- Share my learning journey with the community.
